# TurtleRacing
This program uses Python's built-in turtle module to make an automated turtle race.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Overall, it is pretty self-explanatory.

1. When the program starts, type in a number between 2 and 14 (inclusive) for the number of turtles that should race. Numbers with decimals will be truncated.
2. Type in the color of the turtle that you think will win the race.  The turtles' colors will be shown in the dialog window.  Capitalization does not matter.
   However, spelling must be exact.
3. Finally, choose how much money you want to bet.  You can choose between 0 and 1000 (fake) dollars to bet.  Do not include the "$" when typing in your number.
   Alternatively, you can choose to not bet anything by putting 0 as your bet.
4. Sit back and enjoy the race!
